A child theme based on the [Wordpress TwentySixteen theme](https://wordpress.org/themes/twentysixteen/) for the Hackerspace Adelaide website & blog.

To edit this theme, clone this respository to your local ```wordpress/wp-content/themes/``` folder, along with the TwentySixteen theme.

To override anything in the theme, create a file with the same name as the one you'd like to override in the ```twentysixteen-child``` folder, commit your changes, create a pull request, and we'll pull them into the repo and onto the website.
